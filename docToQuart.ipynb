As consumers, reliability is paramount, but there have been growing concerns about other factors, and new ways of generating electricity have set many power sources apart from the rest. Concerns about mitigation of pollution have also become more pressing as information about the potential harm of power generation has become more widely available. Grid power is more compicated, and the audience is more engaged than ever.\n",
