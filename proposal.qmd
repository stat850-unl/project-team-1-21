## Instructions

Each member of your team should modify this document in some way and push their modifications to the repository in a separate commit. This will ensure that you have set your repository up in a way that ensures all group members are working with the same repository.

Please ensure that you have set your git name and email address on your computer by **modifying** the following commands and running them in the terminal:

```         
git config --global user.name "Ryan Lalicker"
git config --global user.email "rlalicker2@unl.edu"
```

In the proposal as in the final report, all of your code chunks should be set so that `echo = F`, which prevents the code from being printed in the report. You should also set `message = F, warning = F`, which will reduce the amount of additional output which is present in the report. You can customize the execution of code in quarto by using additional options, some of which are detailed [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).

## Data

### Source

**CARSON\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--**

The data we are using in this project comes from "Carson enter here"

If you cannot link directly to the data file, then you need to additionally describe how someone could acquire the same data:

> You can download the data directly using \[process\]

Provide some code to read in the data (either stored in the repository or read in directly from the source).

### Description

This dataset contains information about monthly anuual and monthly power operations by state, sector, and energy source. If includes things like ash content, heat content, sulfer content, and amount of power generated.

It was collected from power sources around the country by the EIA.

Here is a data dictionary showing each variable, the type of variable, units, and range of values that are possible:

Note: this is an example table, please modify to actually match your data. Ensure that all of the same information is represented.

## Project Goals

Describe why this data is interesting and what you hope to do with it.

We will use the dataset to explore the following topics:

-   How much of the energy produced is renewable.

-   Sulfur content in different fuel types.

-   Ash content in different fuel types.

We expect to create:

-   Normal Q-Q plot to test for normality
-   Relative frequency histogram
-   Residuals vs. fitted model plot to check for outliers
-   May include a statistical model (possibly multiple regression)

## Division of Labor

60/40 Carson for R coding.

60/40 Ryan for writing

We hope to have the graphs done and the paper mostly written by Thanksgiving break. Additionally we hope to have many slides completed and a script started by that time.

## Additional Comments

We think this data could potentially provide some challenges. If they are too difficult we may change our project if that is allowed.
